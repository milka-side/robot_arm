"""Cross-host mutual exclusion for anything that submits a goal to
``robot_arm_controller`` (the JTC).

Different clients that submit motion goals (e.g. ``keyboard_servo_node.py``'s
home move / remembered-position replay, or another controller-node's live
align) are separate PROCESSES — and can run on separate HOSTS (operator
control from one machine, planning/execution served from another) — each
perfectly happy to submit a FollowJointTrajectory-family goal to the same
action server. Confirmed live: two such clients racing each other let both
through, racing two goals onto the same controller (see PR review — this is
what this module fixes). Each side already has its own in-process
``threading.Lock`` guarding against racing ITSELF; a plain ``threading.Lock``
only ever protects within the one process that created it, and a ``flock``
(this module's original implementation) only ever protects within the one
HOST it runs on — neither covers one host commanding the arm while another
host's code also does. A ROS service, hosted once by
``arm_motion_lock_server.py`` alongside the controller it actually
arbitrates, is reachable from either host.
