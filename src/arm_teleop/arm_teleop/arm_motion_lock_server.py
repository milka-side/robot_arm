"""Cross-host arm-motion lock server — the network-reachable half of
arm_motion_lock.py's mutual exclusion.

Run once, on whichever host actually owns robot_arm_controller —
NOT per-process, unlike the old /tmp flock this replaces, which only
worked when both callers happened to run on the same machine. Multiple
operator-control clients (e.g. keyboard_servo_node.py, or another
controller-node) can submit goals to the same JTC action server from
different hosts; a plain file lock can't provide mutual exclusion across
that host boundary, a ROS service can.

Lease-based rather than connection-held: a plain acquire/release service
pair can't detect a crashed holder the way flock ties a lock to an open
file descriptor's process lifetime. Every acquire carries a caller-
supplied lease_sec; if the holder never releases (crash, network drop),
the lease simply expires and the lock becomes acquirable again instead
of deadlocking every future request.
